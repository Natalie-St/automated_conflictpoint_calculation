# Automated conflict point calculation in SUMO
This repo provides [code](automated_conflictpoint_calculation.ipynb) to automatically calculate the set of possible conflict points and regions at intersections that are simulated with the microscopic simulation tool SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility). 
The conflict points are determined from connections in the *.net.xml files. 
The conflict-point calculation can be useful e.g. to determine intergreen times or conflict regions for the intersection control of connected and automated vehicles, as [presented](automated_conflictpoint_calculation.ipynb) as the [SUMO User Conference 2024](https://eclipse.dev/sumo/2024/).
